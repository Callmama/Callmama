from callmama_package import initiate_call, get_call_status

# Example: Start a new call
call_id = initiate_call(
    from_number="+1234567890",
    to_number="+1987654321",
    call_plan="Premium",
    duration=15  # Duration in minutes
)

print(f"Call initiated successfully! Call ID: {call_id}")

# Example: Check call status
status = get_call_status(call_id)
print(f"Call Status: {status}")

This will initiate a call and provide updates on its progress. Example outputs might include:
